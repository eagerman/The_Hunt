-1- Our Drac is visiting places not in his legalmove array.
	and even one of the logs i found him going to CastleDracula in the round 0!!
	one of the moves was "??", where the heck did this come from?!! & it throws: Program Output(18): Something fked up
	 here the log page: https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1927ass/16s2.dracula/round02/logs/h-g041-d-g020.log.gz

-2- Comparing our legal movearray to the one printed in the logs, ours is skipping every second place, so the size is actually half of what it is supposed to be.

-3- Many of the cases our program is crashing, and the reason is because Dracula is not allowed to place more than 2 traps in the same city. 
	but the thing is that traps are placed automatically by the GameView.c, we need to use the function whatsThere() to check the number of traps in a city before going in
	Program Output(4426): g020.elf: GameView.c:145: newGameView: Assertion `i < 3' failed.

-4- One other weired behaviour of the program, is use these 2 pasteplays in player.c:
	char *plays = "GGE.... SGE.... HGE.... MGE.... DCD.V.. GGE.... SGE.... HGE.... MGE....";
    char *plays = "GPA.... SMI.... HBE.... MMA.... DLO.V.. GBO.... SFL.... HBC.... MAL.... DPLT... GBA.... SBI.... HCN.... MGR....";

    when u use the first one the debugging printfs are showing up,
    but with the second one they dont, what the heck is this!!

-5- Looks like most of the times our stupid Drac is choosing to Hide
